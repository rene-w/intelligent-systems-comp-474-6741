# Lab Session #01
There is not much content here for the first lab, as it covered a general Q&A about the course, a general round of introductions, and then an introduction to _Python_: 
Students could use the pre-installed Python distribution on the lab computers or install it on their own laptops, using the [Anaconda distribution](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).
Python IDEs were also discussed and we generally recommended to use [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) for the course, unless someone already had previous Python experience and preferred to use a different IDE.

For the Python introduction, we made use of the hands-on material from [UC Berkely](https://ai.berkeley.edu/tutorial.html) and students were asked to complete Q2 and Q3 on their own.
To start with some classic, GOFAI, students were asked to apply their new-found Python skills to make some small changes to the famous _Eliza_ chatbot, as explained in the lab page.
