<h2>Lab Session #01</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Welcome to the COMP474/6741 lab sessions! The goal of these labs is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>learn how to apply the material from the lectures in practice; and</li>
<li>discuss the course project with your team mates and the TA.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the examples provided in the lecture assume you run Linux. But generally, the material covered in the course works cross-platform (Linux, Mac, Windows).</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Task #1: Python</h3>
<p>The first task is to become acquainted with <em>Python</em>, in case you haven't worked with it before. There is a separate intro Lab #00 and a corresponding exercise.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Task #2: Hello, Eliza!</h3>
<p>In the lecture you've seen <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA"><em>Eliza</em></a>, which is probably the oldest example of a chatbot/intelligent agent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find some version of Eliza and try it out: There are many implementations you can run online or offline, <a href="http://psych.fullerton.edu/mbirnbaum/psych101/Eliza.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like this one</a> or <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/elizabot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this one </a>(note that not all versions you will find use the original DOCTOR script);</li>
<li>Make sure you understand <a href="http://www.universelle-automation.de/1966_Boston.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how Eliza works;</a></li>
<li>Here's <a href="https://github.com/wadetb/eliza">a simplified version of Eliza implemented in Python</a>. Clone the GitHub repo so that you can modify and run it locally. Add "Concordia" as a new keyword, together with some suitable decomposition &amp; reassembly rules and try it out, so you can have a conversation similar to this:<br>
<pre>  is:~/eliza-master&gt; python eliza.py
  How do you do.  Please tell me your problem.
  &gt; Concordia doesn't offer free pizza!
  Please tell me more about Concordia!</pre>
</li>
</ul>
