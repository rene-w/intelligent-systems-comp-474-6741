# Intelligent Systems Labs
These are the HTML source code files for the lab exercises of the Winter 2024 version of the Intelligent Systems course at Concordia (COMP 474/6741). 
Note that these were not used stand-alone, but integrated into the course's Moodle site.

## Lab Content
For the 12-week course, there were 11 labs scheduled in total (labs started in the second week), each lab lasting 2 hours and managed by a lab instructor (teaching assistant).
Generally, labs would cover the previous lecture week's concepts, applying the covered theory in practice. The labs also covered general Q&A on lecture material, as well
as the course project.
